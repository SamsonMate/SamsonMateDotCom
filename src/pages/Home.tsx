        <p>
            Hey, my name is Samson Mate, born in Newfoundland in 2005.
            I am a Computer Science student at SMU who aspires to work
            in IT and Cybersecurity. I also enjoy game development which
            I intend to (eventually) put here. This website is meant
            to be a portfolio, front-end for my server, and a place to
            centralize all my work.
        </p>
